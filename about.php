	<h3>What should I bring?</h3>

	<p>Yep! Thank the sponsors!</p>
	<h3>What's the theme?</h3>
	<p>We currently have two categories: <strong>videogames</strong>, and <strong>mobile</strong>. We may be adding more, so keep posted! </p>
	<h3>Will there be a place to sleep? </h3>

	<h3>Can I go even if I don't know anything?</h3>
	<p>Of course! Part of the fun of a hackathon is figurning out things as you go along. We'll also have some great <a href="schedule.php">workshops</a> that you can attend. Or just hang out and have fun!</p>
	<h3>Where can I learn to program before CodeDay?</h3>
	<p>We'll be hosting a workshop at StudentRND on June 23rd for beginners. Alternatively, you can look at <a href="http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/xna-tutorials">these great C#/XNA tutorials</a>, or <a href="http://codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> for Javascript tutorials. </p>

	<p>We will have some loaner Windows Phones, provided by HTC. </p>
	<h3>Do I need a group to attend?</h3>
	<p>We'll be forming teams at the event, so you don't need to know anyone beforehand. Just show up! </p>
	<h3>Is it possible to make an app or game in 30 hours?</h3>
	<p>Yes! We're constantly amazed by the results of CodeDay events! Check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uFSdUq1Gac">S.S. Halfling</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G2RpJQ8yko">Running Blind</a>, both games led by students at Redmond HS.</p>
