		<h1>StudentRND inspires students to work on tech projects in their spare time. </h1>
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Why should I join StudentRND?</h2>
			<p>You're a student, and you're interested in technology. However, </p>
			<ul><li>You're interested in technology, but you don't know where to begin. </li>
				<li>Building robots for a competition is fun, but you want to do something more meaningful. </li>
				<li>Whenever you try to work on a tech project, you never finsh. Perhaps something doesn't work, so you get frustrated and play videogames for the next week. Or you get distracted, because there's a homework assignment tomorrow and a test next week. </li></ul>
			<p>We were frustrated by the same things. That's why we started StudentRND. In 2009, Edward Jiang convinced his friends to hang out at his house and build cool technology projects instead of getting a summer job. And that's grown into StudentRND today, a community of students who help each other do amazing things. </p>
			<h2>What does StudentRND do?</h2>
			<p>In Seattle, StudentRND's built an incredible community around an event during the school year called <a href="http://codeday.org/">CodeDay</a>, and an 8-week summer program called the <a href="http://incubator.studentrnd.org/">StudentRND Incubator</a>. </p>
			<h3>CodeDay</h3>
			<p>At CodeDay, we (high school and college students) get together to build cool apps and games in 24 hours. It's almost like a party, version 2.0; we chug soda, play loud music, and have lots of fun while coding! At the event, we pitch ideas for games, apps, or websites that they think would be awesome. Then, we form teams and build it. It's a fun and friendly atmosphere, and advanced students get the chance to build something amazing, while beginners start learning from the more advanced students. We're always amazed by the creativity from each event, and we see beginners get inspired and take CodeDay as an opportunity to really dig deep and learn more. Building an app or game at CodeDay is an amazing experience, so it's not surprising that many of us decide to start coding and learning afterwards! Compared to other events where students build things for a competition so they can get something nice on their resume, CodeDay is THE best event for high school and college students who want to code! </p>
			<p>We're currently taking CodeDays nationwide, and are looking for volunteers across the country to organize CodeDay. Let us know if you're interested in helping! </p>
			<h3>Incubator</h3>
			<p>During the summer, teams of students apply to and join the StudentRND Incubator, where they focus on building something amazing. At CodeDay, we encourage everyone to build something they think is awesome, at the StudentRND Incubator, teams build something that other people think is awesome, too! We meet at the StudentRND space in Bellevue, WA, where there's resources, tools, equipment, as well as a great community of other passionate, motivated students! </p>
			<p>In the past, students have done quite a bit during the summer! Notable examples include Tapin.tv, YCombinator-backed company, a Plasma Speaker, which raised $18,500 on Kickstarter, Firedove, and Reis Audio!</p>
			<h2>I heard something about a space?</h2>
			<p>In Seattle, we host weekly meetups at our space so that students can use our resources and participate in the community! <a href="/getinvolved/">More info</a></p>
